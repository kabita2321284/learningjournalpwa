      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Week 1:</strong>
          Introduction to Progressive Web Apps and project setup.
        </li>

        <li>
          <strong>Week 2 – Learning Journal PWA:</strong>
          Built a responsive website using HTML and CSS to document weekly progress.
        </li>

        <li>
          <strong>Week 3 – JavaScript and DOM Manipulation:</strong>
          Added dynamic navigation, collapsible sections, and interactivity using JavaScript.
        </li>

        <li>
          <strong>Week 4 – Introduction to APIs:</strong>
          Integrated Storage API (LocalStorage), Clipboard API, and Google Maps Embed API to
          enhance interactivity and usability within the PWA.
        </li>

        <li>
          <strong>Week 5 – Python & JSON Backend Data:</strong>
          Used Python to read and write data to a JSON file, enabling backend-style data storage.
          Implemented reflection counting and keyword filtering to extend JSON functionality.
        </li>

        <li>
          <strong>Week 6 – Frontend–Backend Integration with Flask:</strong>
          Connected the PWA frontend to a Flask backend using GET and POST requests, and implemented
          DELETE as an extra feature. Reflections are stored in a JSON file on PythonAnywhere,
          allowing shared, persistent data and full CRUD-style interaction.
        </li>

        <li>
          <strong>Week 7 – Progressive Web App:</strong>
          Enhanced the Flask application with PWA features including a service worker and Cache
          Storage API for offline access and installability. Used Fetch API for dynamic data loading
          and added an offline status indicator for improved usability.
